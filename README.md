Project Title: Sprint 1 - Working With Data In Python 

Project Description:  This project is a very basic project where I use data cleaning and data preprocessing techniques
using data from the entertainment industry.  I will be using the /datasets/movies_and_shows.csv dataset for this project.
This project consists of basic tasks such as: reading/ uploading the dataset onto a Jupyter notebook, renaming column
names in the dataset appropriately, dealing with missing values, dealing with duplicate values, and very basic data analysis.
