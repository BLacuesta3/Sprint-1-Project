Project Title: Sprint 1 - Working With Data In Python 

Project Description:  This project is a very basic project where I use data cleaning and data preprocessing techniques
using data from the entertainment industry.  I will be using the /datasets/movies_and_shows.csv dataset for this project.
This project consists of basic tasks such as: reading/ uploading the dataset onto a Jupyter notebook, renaming column
names in the dataset appropriately, dealing with missing values, dealing with duplicate values, and very basic data analysis.

Project Dataset: /datasets/movies_and_shows.csv 

Project Tools And Libraries Used:

* Pandas

Methodology:

    1) Data Overview
    
    2) Data Preprocessing (Dealing With Missing Values And Duplicate Values)
    
    3) Basic Data Analysis
